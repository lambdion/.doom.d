* Config
Note that this org file will be tangled to ~config.el~ when ~doom sync~ is run, it will also be tangled when saving an org file in your $DOOMDIR (~/doom.d). See [[https://docs.doomemacs.org/latest/modules/config/literate/]].

* Doom
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src
** Theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-ayu-dark) ; set theme
;;(setq fancy-splash-image (expand-file-name "doom-emacs-gray.png" doom-user-dir)) ;  set splash image
#+end_src

*** Line Numbers
Set line numbers to True, meaning absolute line numbering will always be shown.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)
#+end_src

**** Disable During Zen
I do not want line numbers activated while in Zen Mode (=writeroom-mode=)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-toggle-normal-line-numbers ()
  "Turn line numbers off if in writeroom-mode, otherwise turn on."
  (interactive)
  (if (eq writeroom-mode 't)      ; if writeroom mode is on...
      (setq display-line-numbers nil)   ; turn them off
    (setq display-line-numbers 't)))    ; otherwise turn them back on again

;;; add a hook to run this function when zen mode is activated or deactivated
(add-hook 'writeroom-mode-hook 'my-toggle-normal-line-numbers)
#+end_src
*** Font
See {C-h v doom-font} for documentation on how doom handles fonts.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Noto Sans Mono Medium" :size 22) ; set defaut font
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Noto Sans" :size 22) ; set variable width font
      doom-unicode-font "-GOOG-Noto Sans Mono-medium-normal-normal-*-22-*-*-*-*-0-iso10646-1") ; set unicode font
#+end_src
**** Fix Greek Characters
I had an issue with Greek characters, specifically lambda, not displaying in the correct font. This should fix it.
For some reason, to actually get this to run, I had to call the function after the fact, rather than just calling it in the config. Setting it to run after eshell (the situation in which I am most likely to experiece this issue) fixes this.
To fix greek characters on the fly, simply call {M-x my-greek-font-fix}.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-greek-font-fix ()
  "Set the fontset-default for Greek & Coptic"
  (interactive)
  (set-fontset-font "fontset-default"
                    (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x0370)
                          (decode-char 'ucs #x03ff))
                    "-GOOG-Noto Sans Mono-medium-normal-normal-*-22-*-*-*-*-0-iso10646-1")) ;; Î»e
(after! eshell
  (my-greek-font-fix))
#+end_src
* Evil

* Notes
** Deft
Deft takes a bit of customizing to work with Org Roam, but it does indeed work very well once sorted.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! deft
  ;; Standard Deft Configuration
  (setq deft-extensions '("txt" "md" "org")); file extensions
  (setq deft-directory "~/Documents/Resources/org/roam/"); directory
  (setq deft-recursive nil); dont search directories recursively
  ;; Regexes to work with org-roam
  (setq deft-strip-summary-regexp  ; this is a regexp that processes the "file summary", so ugly metadata doesnt get displayed in the file preview
        (concat "\\("
          "^:.+:.*\n"     ; any line with a :SOMETHING:
          "\\|^#\\+.*\n"  ; any line starting with a #+
          "\\|^\\*.+.*\n" ; any line where an asterisk starts the line
          "\\|\n"         ; any newline characters, so the file summary stays on a single line
          "\\)"))
  (setq deft-strip-title-regexp    ; this is regexp that processes the title, so similar metadata is hidden, otherwise the title would always be #+title: Title
        "\\(?:^%+\\|^#\\+TITLE: *\\|^[#* ]+\\|-\\*-[[:alpha:]]+-\\*-\\|^title:[ ]*\\|#+$\\)")

** Org
The default org directory must be set before it loads, therefore it is outside the ~after!~ block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org directory
(setq org-directory "~/Documents/Resources/org/")
(after! org
  ;; add LaTeX preview to the {SPC m} localleader map in org-mode
  (map! :map org-mode-map
        :localleader
        :n "L" #'org-latex-preview)
)
#+end_src

*** Org Roam
I used to use a load of config to make org-roam nice, but then realized doom had native org support with ~:lang (org +roam2)~, so the only stuff left are my personal requirements.
**** Capture Templates
These are my personal org-roam capture templates
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("d" "default" plain
      "%?"
      :if-new (file+head "${slug}.org" "${title}\n#+date: %U\n#+filetags: :\n")
      :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_src
**** Filename Update
Make it so org-roam files have their filenames updated when the metadata title is updated.

**  Hyperbole
Doing {SPC h h} all the time is cumbersome. {SPC y} is unbound in doom, nice.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map doom-leader-map
      "y" #'hyperbole)
#+end_src
Hyperbole and Org disagree over the {M-RET} key, so I rebind Org's one. Hyperbole has a variable to sort out this disagreement, see {C-h v hsys-org-enable-smart-keys RET} for more info.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! hyperbole
  (setq hsys-org-enable-smart-keys 't)  ; prioritze hyperbole functionality completely over org
  (map! :map org-mode-map               ; rebind org so I can still use it even when on a hyperbole button
      "s-<return>" #'org-meta-return))
#+end_src
I dont like to clutter my home dir with .directories if I can help it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq hbmap:dir-user "/home/nathan/.emacs.doom/hyperbole"))
#+end_src
** Journal
I use a monthly journal using =org-journal= (the ~+journal~ flag in =init.el=).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! org-journal
  ;; Use a monthly format
  (setq org-journal-file-type 'monthly)
  (setq org-journal-file-format "%Y%m")                 ; filenames
  ;; Use valid org-mode timestamps in the headings and subheadings instead of plaintext dates and times
  (setq org-journal-date-format "[%Y-%m-%d %a]")        ; day headings
  (setq org-journal-time-format "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]")) ; time headings
#+end_src
I prefer the keybindings to be the same structure as with Org Roam.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map doom-leader-notes-map
      "j n" #'org-journal-new-entry
      "j N" #'org-journal-new-scheduled-entry

      "j j" #'org-journal-display-entry

* Terminals
** Vterm
Set the default shell to fish
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq vterm-shell "/bin/fish")
#+end_src
** Eshell
There's this cool thing called Smart Shell where your cursor gets put on the command you just executed rather than at the new prompt, meaning:
- You can read the output of the executed command from the top down
- You can use arrow keys to change parts of the command and reexecute the improved one
- You can start typing to begin a new command
Janky, needs some polish for working with evil and company, but useful in some situations
